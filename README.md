# Project 1

## Brief description of Assignment/Project

In this project, we assessed the difficulty level of a pass in a soccer match. To do this, we first looked at different factors that influence a pass. From the number of surrounding opponents in a certain radius to the type of pass used by the player, we managed to assign the impact factor with our own definition and findings. We consider the impact factor to be the sum of 4 factors(surrounding opponents, distance, field position, and type).
