## Brief description of Assignment/Project

In this project, we assessed the difficulty level of a pass in a soccer match. To assses the difficulty, we first looked at different factors that influence a pass.
From the number of surrounding opponents in a certain radius, to the type of pass used by the player, we managed to assign the impact factor to a pass with our own definition. We consider the impact factor to be the sum of 4 factors (surrounding opponents, distance, field position, and type).
